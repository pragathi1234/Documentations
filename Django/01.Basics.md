### What is Django?
1. Django is python web development framework(3rd party module which you install on your system)
2. Built for Python 3.x
3. Offers built-in solutions and features for basically all problems
4. It can be used in real time projects

### Prerequisites
1. Basic Python
2. Basic web development knowledge

### Installations
1. Python
2. Django **pip install Django**

### Creating Django project
1. Navigate to folder where you need to start project
2. **django-admin startproject (project name)** - This creates a new folder
    manage.py - This gives access to some built in django commands
    (project name folder)
        init.py - This will be empty, only access python modules
        settings.py - Contains bunch of global settings and configurations
        urls.py - This is used for registering html pages
        wsgi.py, asgi.py - These are required at the time of deployement

### Starting development server
1. Goto terminal
2. Enter into created project
3. Run **python3 manage.py runserver portnumber**(optional)
4. Open browser, check with IP
5. Now your project is up and running

### Django apps(modules)
1. Run **python3 manage.py startapp (App name)**, This creates a sub folder into main folder
2. We can create many apps in a project
    migrations folder - This has empty init file, This is used when we create databases and models
    admin.py - Built in administration area
    apps.py - Configures app name
    models.py - Required at the time of creating db
    tests.py - Automated or unit tests
    views.py - Logic to determine the users visibility

### Urls(Routes) & Views
URL-Action mappings which ensure that certain results are "achieved" when certain URLs are entered by the user.
Views is the logic that executed for different URLs

### Data 
There are 3 types of data
1. Temporary --> Stored in variables such as user entered details or selected blog posts
2. Semi-persistent --> Stored in temporary files such as authentication details
3. Persistent --> Stored in database such as user details, passwords etc

### Databases
There are 2 main types of databases
1. SQL : Stored in table format
2. NoSQL : Stored in document format

### Models
1. Create a class in models.py
2. Add app in settings.py 
3. Create migrations - **python3 manage.py makemigrations**
4. Run migrations - **python3 manage.py migrate**

#### Inserting data
1. In terminal **python3 manage.py shell**
2. import created model using **from (app-name).models import (class-name)**
3. Create an instance using **Harry_potter=Book(title="The Harry potter",rating=5)**, here Book-class-name
4. Save the instance **Harry_potter.save()**

(OR)

1. Use create method **Book.objects.create(title="HP",ratins=5,author="JK",is_bestseller=True)**

#### Retrieving all entries
**Book.objects.all()**

### Updating Models and Migrations
1. Update schema (ex-add columns in models.py)
2. Create and run migrations
3. Open shell and get all objects
4. To get specific index data **Book.objects.all()[1]**
5. To get specific column name for specific index **Book.objects.all()[1].author**

**Note** Migrations is required only if you make changes in schema

#### Updating Data
1. Create an instance for required row **harry_potter=Book.objects.all()[0]**
2. Add values to created instance **harrypotter.author="R.k"**
3. Save instance **harry_potter.save()**
4. Checkfor updates **Book.objects.all()[0].author**

#### Deleting Data
1. Create an instance for required row **harry_potter=Book.objects.all()[0]**
2. Delete **harry_potter.delete()**

### Querying and Filter
Book.objects.get(id=3) --> Shows error when there are multiple values

Book.objects.filter(rating=5) --> This gives multiple values

Book.objects.filter(rating__gte=3) --> Greater than 3

Book.objects.filter(rating__gte=3,title__contains="harry") --> multiple conditions

#### OR Condition
import django.db.models import Q

Book.objects.filter(Q(rating__lt=3) | Q(is_bestselling=True))

### Bulk Operations
Delete multiple model instances-https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#deleting-objects

Update multiple models instances-https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-update

Create multiple models instances-https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#bulk-create


## Admin
Creating superuser - **python3 manage.py createsuperuser**

#### Adding model to admin
from .models import Book

admin.site.register(Book)

#### Configuring field values
Removing error entering slug - add **null=False** in models.py for slug variable

#### Making fields readable using admin.py
class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    
    readonly_fields=("slug",)

admin.site.register(Book,BookAdmin)

#### Prepopulating fields
add **prepopulated_fields={"slug":("title",)}** in admin.py file

#### Filter data using rating and author
list_filter = ("rating","author")
    
#### Displaying contents of column name
list_display= ("title","author")


### Relationships(Multiple tables)
